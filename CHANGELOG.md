# Changelog

All notable changes to BandChat are documented here.

## [1.04.95] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Link preview dismissal** — Message authors can remove link previews from their messages (X button on hover/tap). Persists via `hidePreview` field on Message model. Works on web, mobile, and threads.
- **Swipe to react** — Left-swipe on messages to toggle thumbs-up reaction (amber panel). Right-swipe still replies (blue panel). Both in channels and threads.
- **Stage plots** — SVG-based drag-and-drop stage plot editor with 20+ equipment icons, collapsible palette sections, draggable text labels, print/PDF export (web + mobile)
- **Workspace backup/restore** — Per-workspace manual backups to R2 (max 5 per workspace), with full restore including safety backup
- **iPad optimization** — `useLayout()` hook with tablet constraints (700px content, 500px modals) rolled out to all 41 mobile screens
- **Code review fixes** — Filename sanitization on uploads, search rate limiting, sync route hardening, ErrorState with retry on key screens, theme-aware ErrorBoundary

### Fixed
- **Delete message not working** — Action sheet Modal closing animation conflicted with Alert on iOS. Added 350ms delay between Modal close and action dispatch.
- **Home button loops back** — Users with only one workspace couldn't reach the workspace list to join a new workspace. Home button now bypasses auto-navigate.
- **DM names showing raw IDs** — Push notification and deep link navigation to DM channels showed `dm-userId1-userId2` instead of display names. Now resolves member names before navigating.
- **DM display name resolution** — `getDMDisplayName` now prefers the `otherMembers` field from the server response for more reliable name resolution.
- Mobile gig detail missing time display (times showed in calendar list but not detail)
- Account deletion wording clarified — explicitly states it affects all workspaces, not just current one
- Backup system: fixed `pinnedAt` → `createdAt` in PinnedMessage restore, removed invalid `isEdited` field, included soft-deleted records, added concurrency guard
- Sync routes: fixed socket room names, added type validation and rate limiting
- LiveModeScreen: replaced hardcoded `top: 50` with `useSafeAreaInsets()`
- Admin: workspace backup path traversal validation, generic error messages

### Changed
- Extracted `formatDuration` and `getInitial` utility functions to reduce code duplication
- Migrated 12 web modals to reusable `Modal.jsx` component
- Standardized empty states across web components

## [1.04.59] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Gig time fields** — Sound check, doors open, and stage times for gigs (all optional)
- **Setlist rename** — Edit setlist names inline in the builder header or via context menu/card actions
- **Mobile API caching** — In-memory TTL cache for API responses with auto-invalidation on mutations
- **Memoization** — React.memo on SongCard and SetlistCard components with useCallback handlers
- **JSDoc + checkJs** — TypeScript-like type checking for JavaScript files via tsconfig.json

### Fixed
- **Mobile calendar times** — Times now save and display correctly (embedded in datetime fields)
- **Message text selection** — Users can now select and copy message text on web
- **Duplicate function name** — Fixed build error from handleDeleteSong naming conflict

### Changed
- Gig form shows 3 optional time fields (Sound Check, Doors, Stage Time) for GIG type events only
- Mobile gig detail screen displays all time fields when set

## [1.04.49] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Soft-delete system** for users and workspaces — 30-day grace period before permanent deletion
- Prisma middleware auto-filters soft-deleted records from all queries (no per-file changes needed)
- Admin dashboard "Deleted Items" tab with restore and purge actions
- Admin API endpoints: list deleted, restore users/workspaces, purge users/workspaces
- Daily scheduled purge job for records past the 30-day grace period
- R2 file cleanup on workspace purge
- **Demo workspace seeder** — `seed-demo-workspace.js` creates "Lunar Moth" band with 6 members, 460+ messages, songs, setlists, gigs, and all features populated
- Former/guest band member support in demo data (member leaves, guest fills in, member returns)

### Fixed
- Hardcoded ¥ currency symbol in Gig Archive and Calendar — now uses workspace currency setting
- Revenue showing as concatenated string instead of sum (Prisma Decimal → Number conversion)

### Changed
- User account deletion now soft-deletes (sets `deletedAt`, revokes tokens) instead of immediate hard-delete
- Workspace deletion now soft-deletes instead of immediate hard-delete
- Auth middleware returns 401 "Account has been deleted" for soft-deleted users
